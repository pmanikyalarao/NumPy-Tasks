# NumPy Basics Tasks

Welcome to the **NumPy Basics Tasks Repository**! This repository contains a collection of tasks and examples to help you learn and explore the basics of [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), a powerful Python library for numerical computing.

## ðŸ“– About NumPy

NumPy is an essential library for numerical and scientific computing in Python. It is widely used in fields such as data science, machine learning, and computational mathematics. Key features of NumPy include:

- **N-dimensional arrays** for efficient data storage and manipulation.
- **Mathematical operations** like linear algebra, statistics, and random number generation.
- **Integration** with other Python libraries like SciPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.


## ðŸ”‘ Key Topics Covered

1. **NumPy Array Basics**:
   - Creating arrays using `numpy.array()`, `numpy.zeros()`, `numpy.ones()`, etc.
   - Understanding array attributes (`shape`, `size`, `dtype`).

2. **Array Indexing and Slicing**:
   - Accessing elements, subarrays, and modifying array elements.

3. **Mathematical Operations**:
   - Array arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
   - Statistical functions (mean, median, standard deviation).

4. **Broadcasting**:
   - Performing operations on arrays of different shapes efficiently.

5. **Linear Algebra**:
   - Operations like dot product, matrix multiplication, and solving equations.

6. **Random Number Generation**:
   - Generating random arrays using `numpy.random`.
