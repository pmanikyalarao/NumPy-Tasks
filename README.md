# 🐍 NumPy Practice Problems

Welcome to the **NumPy Practice Problems** repository!  
This collection of exercises is designed to help you master essential **NumPy** concepts and techniques.  
The problems are divided into two levels of difficulty: **Simple** and **Expanded**, so learners of all levels can benefit.

## 📂 Repository Structure

This repository provides both **problems** and their **solutions** in a clear and accessible format:

- **Simple Problems**
  - `Simple_NumPy_Practice_Problems.docx` → Document with beginner-level tasks (array creation, attributes, basic operations).
  - `simpleNumpyTasks.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook containing the solutions to simple problems.

- **Expanded Problems**
  - `Expanded_NumPy_Practice_Problems.docx` → Document with advanced problems (matrix operations, linear algebra, normalization).
  - `ExtendedNumpyTasks.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook with the solutions to expanded problems.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the repository and start solving problems.

### 🔧 Prerequisites

Make sure you have **Python 3.6+** and **NumPy** installed:

```bash
pip install numpy
```

If you want to run the solutions in Jupyter Notebook, also install:

```bash
pip install notebook
```

---

### 📥 Clone the Repository

Open your terminal (or command prompt) and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pmanikyalarao/NumPy-Tasks
```

Navigate into the project folder:

```bash
cd NumPy-Tasks
```

---

### ▶️ Running the Notebooks

To view and run the solutions:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

This will open a tab in your browser. From there:
- Navigate to the repository folder.
- Open the `.ipynb` files (`simpleNumpyTasks.ipynb` or `ExtendedNumpyTasks.ipynb`).
- Run the code cells interactively.

## 💡 Key Topics Covered

This repository covers a wide range of **NumPy functionalities**:

### ✅ Simple Problems
- **Array Creation** → Create arrays with specific values or ranges.  
- **Array Attributes** → Understand `.shape` vs `.size`.  
- **Mathematical Operations** → Find minimum, maximum, mean, etc.  
- **Indexing & Slicing** → Extract rows/columns and reshape arrays.  
- **Conditional Operations** → Replace values and find indices based on conditions.  

### 🔥 Expanded Problems
- **Advanced Array Creation** → Checkerboard patterns, linearly spaced numbers, diagonal matrices.  
- **Array Manipulation** → Flattening, reversing, stacking arrays vertically/horizontally.  
- **Matrix Operations** → Perform sums, differences, products, transposes, inverses.  
- **Linear Algebra** → Solve systems of equations, compute eigenvalues & eigenvectors.  
- **Normalization** → Scale arrays to a specific range (e.g., 0 → 1).  

---

## 🎯 Goal

The goal of this repository is to provide **hands-on practice** for mastering NumPy, from beginner-friendly problems to intermediate and advanced challenges.
